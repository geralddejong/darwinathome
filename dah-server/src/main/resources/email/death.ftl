Hello ${being.name},

I'm sorry to inform you that your Tetragotchi has died of starvation.  You are still a member of the Tetragotchi
game and you can start up the game again anytime you want and create a fresh new Tetragotchi, just like the first time
you played.

To play again, you can either click on your Tetragotchi icon or on a file called tetragotchi.jnlp somewhere on your
drive.  If you can't find either of these, you can login here again: http://tetragotchi.com/tetragotchi/login.html

We hope to see you back soon.

Contact me if you have any trouble.
