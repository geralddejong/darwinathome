Welcome!

You have been invited by player "${player.email}" to join in the evolution on
Tetragotchi World.

Tetragotchi is a multi-player online game that stretches your sense of time.
You create your own tetragotchi and it lives on in slow motion even after
you log out.

While playing you use an accelerated Darwininan Natural Selection to develop
locomotion for grazing and hunting.  Without your occasional evolution help
and guidance, your tetragotchi will not fare well in the competition to survive.

The object of the game is to assimilate as many other tetragotchis as possible, while
avoiding assimilation yourself.  When a tetragotchi is assimilated it dies and is
reborn with exactly the same shape as its "maker", but without the ability to get
around.
